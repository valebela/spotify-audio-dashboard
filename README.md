## 🎯 Dashboard Purpose

This project analyzes how musical characteristics vary across tracks:

- **Tempo:** Shows typical speed ranges and outliers.  
- **Energy vs Danceability:** Dense clusters reveal popular combinations in modern music.  
- **Valence:** Emotional positivity of tracks, highlighting patterns across genres.  
- **Top Tracks:** Lists the most popular songs based on Spotify's popularity metric.

By visualizing these features, the dashboard helps explain why certain songs feel energetic, danceable, or emotionally positive.
